  <p>Welcome to BioDex, a species classification tool for Taxonomists <em>developed by <a href="https://www.librarylab.ethz.ch/">ETH Library Lab</em></a>.</p>
  <p>Currently, the application is being actively developed and user accounts can be created by invitation only.</p>
  <p>The current classification model has been trained on 560 species of butterflies. New models are being develeoped for all Lepidoptera families and more.</p>
  <p>Taxonomists, Collection Managers, Developers and hobbyists, we would love to hear from you! If you are interested in testing this species identification service, contributing to this project or just sharing your thoughts please get in touch with us via the <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact form</a>.</p>
