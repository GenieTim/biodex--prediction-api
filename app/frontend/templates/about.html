    <p>Sorting the backlog of physical butterfly and moth specimens at the ETH Entomological Collection 
        will require the assistance of staff and volunteers who have no prior training in species identification. 
        To enable these individuals to contribute effectively, they require a technological aid to allow them to 
        differentiate between the different hierarchical groupings of butterflies and moths. This will allow the 
        workload for subject experts to be significantly reduced.

    <p>
    A publicly available mobile application for non-expert entomological collection workers, which suggests the 
    most likely species for each specimen of butterfly or moth photographed. This will allow the non-expert staff 
    to correctly sort the majority of specimens which can later be quickly checked by an expert.
